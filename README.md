# crazytaxi
Simple, interactive car game developed using Java.

Our project will focus mainly on a major Car object which will be accompanied with other major and minor objects. 
The car is to move along a road for as long as it can without hitting the obstacles. 
These obstacles will play their part as the minor objects and include cacti, bushes, and other plants. 
The car is going to be a red color, while the sky and ground will be cyan and brown, respectively. 
The user will be able to use the arrow keys to make the car move left or right, up or down. 
Also, the user will not only have to avoid the obstacles but will need to remain on the road, which is called “inbounds”, as well. 
For every second the car continues to move without hitting an obstacle or going out of bounds of the road, a point will be added in the top right corner as a distance marker. 
The final number of seconds the car is said to be “alive” before “dying” will count as the user's final score.
